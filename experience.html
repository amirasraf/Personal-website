	<p style="width: 70%; text-align: justify;">The experience that i have is, i have 6 month of working experience as a part time cashier in BH Petrol Salor 2. As a cashier, i learn so many things there such as communication skills and promotion skills. The cashier job is to communicate with the customer and gives them the best experience to be in our shop and hoping that they will come again next time. We also try really hard to do promotion because we had a certain quota that we need to fulfill for the promotion to report it to the headquarters of BH Petrol. Besides that, we have to be precise in counting the money to give the change back to the customer and also must be able to multitask since the customer at the petrol station is quite a lot. </p>
	<br>
	<p style="width: 70%; text-align: justify;">Next, i have 6 month of internship at Top Glove in information technology field. In this company, i gains a lot of knowledge such as how to write a report and also how to write down the meetings important information. Being intern in this company makes me improve myself on time management, punctuality and communication skills. For me, these three skills is really important and also a key for success at a job and college. Not only that, these skills also are highly sought after by company. I learned so many things from the intership in this company.</p>
	<br>
	<p style="width: 70%; text-align: justify;">there are a lot of things that i learned from these two jobs that i landed and basically i get a chance to enchance my skill such as using Microsoft Excel, my editting skills, my programming skills and so on. </p>
