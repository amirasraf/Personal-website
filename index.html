	<div align="center">
		<p style="width: 60%; text-align: justify;">First and foremost, praises and thanks to the god, the Almighty, for his showers of blessing throughout my effort to create this website successfully and being able to complete it in time. </p>

		<p style="width: 60%; text-align: justify;">The purpose of this website is to tell more about myself. It doesn't serve any specific purpose beside explaining all about me from my biodata, family, experience, education and also some gallery. this website includes my biodata where explaining more about me such as where i was born, date of born and so many other things that were not included anywhere such as my hobby and also passion. the main reason of me creating this website is because of my subject IMD 311 assignment that were lead by Miss Ainatul Mardiah. Without her guidance and knowledge that were given to me, i can't complete this assignment and also the website will not be as beautiful as this. She's the one that deserves all the credit given for this website. </p>
		
		<p style=" width: 60%; text-align: justify;">Next, i also want to express my gratitude towards my coursemate and friends for their effort and time to explain to me about something that i couldn't undertand in class. it is something that really helpful and meaningful to me. lastly, i want to thanks my parent for their love and also raising me and send me to this university. without that, i couldn't be here creating this websites.</p>
